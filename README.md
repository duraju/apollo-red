# Heart Ratedetection using FLiR Infrared Imaging Sensor
This project involves using an FLiR sensor to measure the heart rate, breath rate and temperature of a person and report the results to an online web dashboard for viewing. These properties should be able to be measured for both stationary and in motion individuals, using machine learning to accurately track and measure the test subject.

# apollo-red
The short title of this project is Apollo-Red, being inspired by the Greek god of Medicine (Apollo) and colour of the heart (red).
